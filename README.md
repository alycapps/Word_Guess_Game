# Word_Guess_Game
This is a fun Hangman style game. All of the words are Broadway shows and the purpose of this game is purely entertainment. 

The game is designed to be simple to play and users should just type any letter a-z to make guesses on what letters they think the secret word contains. If accurate the guesses will be filled in, if inaccurate Guesses Remaining will go down by 1. If the User has used all of their guesses before the game guessing the word, then losses will go up by 1 and they will be able to start a new game.
